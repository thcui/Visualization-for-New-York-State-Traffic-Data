# Data transformation

## For Short Count Volume dataset

### Drop unnecessary columns

We dropped the following columns as they are not necessary for our tasks
```
DATA_TYPE, RC_STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, FLAG_FIELD, RCSTA, FACTOR_GROUP, VEHICLE_AXLE_CODE, BATCH_ID, CHANNEL_NOTES

```

### Aggregate the Time Columns
The original dataset includes the volumn count for every 15 mins, which is too detailed and such many columns would make our plots to be complex. Thus, we combined them to have one count per hour, for each set of observation.

### Use region name to replace region code
We need to show the name for each region to let the user to know which region it is instead of using a code, this is needed when we made many plots, so we transformed the dataset.

### Use county name to replace the combination of region code and county code
We need to use the county name as the key to pair with the data in the shapefile, but there is no county name provided. So we have to combine the region code and county code to get the county and translate it to the county name following the official document "NYSDOT Region and County Codes".
