# Data transformation


## For Short Count Volume dataset
### Drop unnecessary columns


We dropped the following columns as they are not necessary for our tasks
```
DATA_TYPE, RC_STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, FLAG_FIELD, RCSTA, FACTOR_GROUP, VEHICLE_AXLE_CODE, BATCH_ID, CHANNEL_NOTES

```
          
### Use region name to replace region code
### Use county name to replace the combination of region code and county code
