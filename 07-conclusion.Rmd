# Conclusion

In conclusion, as we take an overview of the traffic data in the New York State, we find that the general trend and level are very similar between 2018 and 2019, where the streets are busy in the first three months in each year. However, the data in the first half of 2020 seems quite abnormal, which suggests a possibility that it is affected by COVID-19. We then used a parallel coordinate plot to see the relationships between the regions and street type, and drew the conclusion that New York City, with a 0 volume in rural area, is quite different from other regions. As we move on to study the distribution of vehicle count among different regions, we found that streets in New York City are always the busiest among regions in New York State from 2018 to 2020.
