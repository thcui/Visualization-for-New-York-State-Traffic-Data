[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In conclusion, as we take an overview of the traffic data in the New York State, we find that the general trend and level are very similar between 2018 and 2019, where the streets are busy in the first three months in each year. However, the data in the first half of 2020 seems quite abnormal, which suggests a possibility that it is affected by COVID-19. Therefore, we compare the traffic data and the COVID-19 data in each month, and conclude that people will be more likely to stay home and do not drive their cars when there is an outbreak of the pandemic. We then use a parallel coordinate plot to see the relationships between different variables, and draw the conclusion that New York City, with a 0 volume in rural area, is quite different from other regions. As we move on to study the distribution of vehicle count among different regions, we find that streets in New York City are always the busiest among regions in New York State from 2018 to 2020. Moreover, we use bar charts to find which streets are the busiest in New York State, and the result suggests that the busiest streets are mostly from New York City (NYC) and Hauppauge in 2018 and 2019 but it turns out that the top 15 busiest streets are all from NYC in 2020. We then conduct research on the difference of traffic volume among different day of week. We first use a boxplot to show the distribution of vehicle count among different day of week, and it turns out that streets in New York States are busiest on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and least busy on Friday from 2018 to 2020. Then, we compare the difference of traffic volume on weekdays and weekends among different regions using a diverging stacked bar chart, and concludes that regions like Hauppauge and New York City have much more cars on weekdays than weekends, which somehow correlated with the location of busiest streets we found previously.
