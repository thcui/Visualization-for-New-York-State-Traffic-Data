The New York State Department of Transportation(NYSDOT) monitored and gathered the traffic data including vehicle classification, volume and speed, and they are accessible as comma delimited text files. The New York State Department of Health(NYSDOH) reported the New York State Statewide COVID-19 testing results and and it is also accessible as comma delimited text files. From the data sources listed above, we utilized two datasets from NYSDOT: Short Count Volume dataset and Average Weekday Speed dataset, and one dataset from NYSDOH: New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing dataset. 2.1 Short Count Volume dataset from the New York State Department of Transportation Link to the dataset: https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/highway-data-services/hdsb This dataset contains information about the traffic count for different time slots on different days from 2018 to 2020, so we can get the general pattern, and help us analyze how COVID-19 impact the pattern of traffic volume. It has very detailed information for each record, such as region, county, direction, etc., so that we can group data by different categories and get insights about the patterns for each kinds of groups. Table 2.1: Major columns used Column Description COUNT_ID A unique ID for each count session loaded, each count has one Count_ID for all data types. REGION A single digit code for each NYSDOT Region. Can be concatenated with County_Code and Station number to create a unique ID COUNTY_CODE A single digit code for each County within a NYSDOT Region. Can be concatenated with Region_Code and Station number to create a unique ID STATION A four digit number unique within a county representing a specific segment of road for traffic counting purposes. Can be concatenated with Region_Code and County_Code to create a unique ID. SPECIFIC_RECORDER_PLACEMENT Verbal description of the primary counter placement. YEAR The year in which the data was collected. MONTH The month in which the data was collected. DAY The Day of data collection. DAY_OF_WEEK The day of week the data was collected. FEDERAL_DIRECTION The federal direction code for the data record. 1 – North, 3 – East, 5 – South, 7 – West, 9 – North/South Combined, 0 – East/West combined LANE_CODE The lane code by direction, starting with 1 as the rightmost lane. LANES_IN_DIRECTION The total number of lanes expected in this direction. Interval_1_1 through Interval_24_4 Volume Data for each 15 minute interval. The hourly data will be represented in intervals 1_1, 2_1, etc. TOTAL The sum of all intervals for the record. Potential issues found in this dataset: The data for January 2020 and February 2020 seems to be missing. There are some rows with the data in the wrong columns, for example, there are 6 rows with DATATYPE=2020, YEAR=6, MONTH=1, DAY=Tuesday, which seems not valid but may be an input error, we need to fix them manually. 2.2 Average Weekday Speed dataset from the New York State Department of Transportation Link to the dataset: https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/highway-data-services/hdsb As it provided the average speed data for each day, we can combine it with the short count volume dataset to see the relationship between the traffic count and the average speed for each day on average. This helps us solve the second question above. 2.3 New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing dataset Link to the dataset: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data This dataset provides the number of new positive and cumulative cases of Covid-19 in the New York State from 2020 March 1st to the present. Thus, we can use it to make a plot showing the trend of the pandemic for the entire state, and then compare the trend with traffic volume in the New York state. This helps us solve the third question above. 2.4 Other resources https://www.dot.ny.gov/regional-offices The above website provided us the way to interpret the region data, the original region data is the number corresponding to each regions.(ex. 11 for New York City) https://www.dot.ny.gov/gisapps/functional-class-maps This website provided us the way to interpret the functional class data, the original region data is the number corresponding to each classification.(ex. 01 represents interstate principal arterial in the rural area) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We will first make a visna plot for the transformed dataset, which provides a good first overview of the missing values: Here we only show the most frequent 15 patterns as the number of patterns in total is huge and most of the patterns only have a few occurrences. By investigating the above plot, we found there are a lot of missing data for the average speed of the car per day, so we are considering removing it, as the huge missing of the data would make the result based on it unreliable. Half of the rows in the data have no missing data except for the average speed, but the rest half have very different kinds of missing patterns. We also noticed that the rest of the missing data are mostly from the vehicle count data(count-per-hour) for different periods during a day, so we decided to do more investigation focus on them to understand these missing patterns. Regrading to count-per-hour data, we noticed that most of the missing patterns would have missing data for a continuous-time interval(ex. 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm .etc). We suspect that this may be because the data are collected for a continuous hour period (eg. 24/36/48 continuous hours), so the hours without any counting are often continuous. To do more investigation focus on count-per-hour data, we first made a bar plot to check the trend of number of missing value with time. For the count for different time interval, it seems that there are more missing of the data from 7am to 7pm, but the number of missing data does not different by a lot for each time interval. Then we further made the plots showing the missing value for specific time period and date for each count session. ## [1] &quot;English_United States.1252&quot; We made many plots as above, and here we use the count session in November 2020 from New York County in New York City as an example. By using the many plots just as the above, we can easily find, for each count session, it counts the volume of cars for continuous hours and it is recorded as a whole day even not all the hours in that day are counted. This leads to the majority of missing data in the dataset as the rest of the hours during the day(red area) are recorded as NA. Also, we indeed found some random missing value that does not follow this pattern, but they are much less frequent. After checking the documentation, there is no explanation for these missing values, so we wound treat them as errors.

In general, we can see the streets in the New York State is busy in the first three months in each year. The general trend and level are very similar between 2018 and 2019, but the counts for the first half of the year of 2020 is much lower than other years, which suggested us that there may be some effects from the COVID-19. We have also noticed that there is no data for the January and February for 2020, this may due to the COVID-19 or other errors in the dataset, but there is no official explanation for them. 5.1.2 The comparison between rural and urban areas for their trend of the average count Average count for a street per hour for rural and urban areas in different regions In general, it seems the number of counts in the rural expressway is positively correlated with the number in other rural roads, and the number of counts in the urban expressway is positively correlated with the number in other urban roads, The New York City is seemingly different from other regions as there is 0 volume count for the rural area. From the second plot, we can tell more than half of the regions in New York State have very high vehicle volume in the urban area, but the others tend to have similar amount in both rural and urban areas. For most of the regions, the volume are concentrated at the express ways. 5.1.3 The busiest streets in New York State from 2018 to 2020 From the plots above, we can see there are more busy streets from New York City(NYC) from 2018 to 2020, and it turns out that the 15 busiest streets are all from NYC on 2020. This suggest us that there may be something different between NYC and other counties, and we should take a closer look to NYC in the further analysis. 5.1.4 The average count for different time slots in a week "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
